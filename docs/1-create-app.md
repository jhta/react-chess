#Creating the first App

For this step, we used [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) for generate a simple develop environment

After of install globally 'create-react-app', run:

`create-react-app react-chess`

For this case, We don't need re-create the App.

For try the app, we create the `Table.js` component and Render that.
